# FNAF_Horror_Game2
 
 This was the project that took me the longest to create, and is the most complicated to play. It is based on the popular horror game series Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF).<br/>It requires all of the sound and image files and folders in the repisitory to run, and unfortunately only works on my macbook's specific screen resolution, however other windows can be resized to this small resolutiom.

When first playing, do the tutorial on the homescreen. All the controls should be explained.

IMPORTANT: set the screen width to 1700px and screen height to 1050px to properly play (fullscreen cannot work). Reload the page once the width and height have been corrected. You can see the width and height with window.screen.height and window.screen.width in the console.
